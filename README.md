# AForge.NET fork

This is a fork of https://github.com/andrewkirillov/AForge.NET by Andrew Kirillov which migrates the projects referenced by DentalCAD to .NET6. These projects are

 - Core
 - Video
 - Video.DirectShow
 
## Compiling the migrated projects

A VS2022 solution containing only the migrated projects can be found ins the `Sources` folder at: `./Sources/AForge.Video-Exocad.sln`

## Important Note

Projects not used by DentalCAD remain unaltered. Therefore, some solutions within the repository *might not* compile.
